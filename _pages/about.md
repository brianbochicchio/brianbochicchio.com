I'm a photographer and creative technologist based in Central Illinois. My background is in journalism and public affairs — I spent years telling stories for the Department of Defense — and that training never really left. I still look for the human detail, the quiet moment, the thing that reveals more than it shows.

The camera is how I pay attention. I shoot infrared and whatever else stops me in my tracks — statues, machines, insects, light doing something it shouldn't. I'm less interested in perfect technique than in images that have a pulse.

The "creative technologist" part means I build things. iOS apps, websites, tools that help creative work happen with less friction. I think in systems but I don't trust systems that forget they're supposed to serve people.

I use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement. Some of my favorite images started as a prompt and ended as something I couldn't have made any other way. I'm honest about that.

This site is where the work and stories live.
