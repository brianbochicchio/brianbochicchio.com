It's crazy.  How quick this has come toghter.  

So I wrapped up the basic site structure and coding last night.   And thought, how can I make this even easier to use. 
I don't mind, hand-crafting articles. But image upload and be tendious.  

This morning I added a script to upload the image and update the correct gallery (collecition) with the image.  So now submitting images
is as simple as prepping the image, dropping it in a folder and executing a command line.  I am thinking this would be a fun open source 
project for othe tech-savvy photographers. 

Once I flesh my own site out more, I might just do that.  

Essentially this is a near zero cost site.  I used GitHub pages for hosting and CloudFlare R2 (free plan for now).  Also no CMS or complex back-end.  What's not to love.
