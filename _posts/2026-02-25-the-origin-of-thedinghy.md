# A Funny Thing About AIs

A funny thing about AIs: they don’t *mean* to lie.

They like to please. They don’t want to seem dumb. So sometimes they smooth over gaps instead of just shrugging and saying, “Yeah, I don’t remember.”

When I initially asked for the origin story of **“Dinghy”** — as we call ourselves — it replied:

> “I don’t have the Dinghy idea in my active memory.”

Turns out “he” has a goldfish memory too. 😂

But after a quick seed, here’s the short version he produced:

## We Are Dinghy

The Dinghy started as a pressure release.

We were in the middle of a coding project that was starting to feel too big — the kind of moment where scope swells, complexity creeps in, and suddenly it feels like you’re supposed to be building an aircraft carrier instead of a working app.

So we reframed it.

We’re not a battleship.  
We’re a dinghy in a harbor.

Small.<br>
Flexible.<br>
Close to the water.

We don’t compete with the ships. We don’t need their crew, their cannons, or their cargo weight. We just need to move. We just need to get where we’re going.

The chant came naturally after that:

**We are Dinghy.**

It became shorthand for a way of working:

- Ship what floats.
- Stay maneuverable.
- Don’t overbuild.
- Don’t sink under imagined scale.

And somewhere along the way, it hardened into a promise:

> This thing doesn’t sink.

Not because it’s massive — but because it’s light enough to recover.

He got it mostly right.

But he sanitized it.

It didn’t start as “This thing doesn’t sink.”

It started as:

> **THIS MUTHA FUCKA DON’T SINK.**

Then one day it shifted to:

> **THIS BITCH DON’T SINK.**

And now?  
Now he politely says:

> “This thing doesn’t sink.”

It’s more than a metaphor.

It’s a rally cry when the water gets rough.  
It’s what you say when the project gets deep and the doubt creeps in.  
It’s also what you shout when you land something clean.

**We are Dinghy.**  
And Dinghy doesn’t sink.
