Two sessions, one cup of coffee, and a brief hostage situation with GoDaddy.

I built this site because I was tired of paying Zenfolio to host work I own, on a platform I don't control, with a design I didn't choose. Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare R2 turned out to be a cleaner stack than anything I'd paid for.

The whole thing cost an afternoon and some mild frustration with Ruby environment setup on macOS. Worth it.

More on the process later. For now — the dinghy floats.
